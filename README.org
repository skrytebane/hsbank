* hsbank

Just experimenting with the [[https://sbanken.no/][Sbanken]]-API and Haskell.

(This is probably horribly wrong in all sorts of ways.)

** Build

: $ stack build

** Run

1. Put a JSON file with the credentials that you got from Sbanken's
   API page into a file called ~~/secrets/sbanken.json~:

   #+BEGIN_SRC js
   {
     "customer": "12345612345",
     "apiKey": "fbabd5687897da89798798b789798a",
     "secret": "ufhiuhiuBJKNuihiu89789-789hfkje=fewewf343MZ",
     "expires": "2018-01-03T00:00:00.000Z"
   }
   #+END_SRC

2. ~$ stack exec hsbank~
